I love Morgann McCarthy
=======================

Intro is a work in progress, but Morgann, I love you so much. And I don't always share all the times I feel it. I'm sorry.
This list is one moment from each day where I felt so loved, where I just so appreciated your love, where I felt an abundance of love for you, or something along those lines.
Just because I picked only one thing does not mean it was the only thing that day. That is never the case. But if I listed absolutely every action that made me feel love for you or from you, I wouldn't be able to keep up typing them all. 
My only regret is not thinking of this idea sooner.

| Year | Month     | Day | Where I Saw Love |
| ---- | --------- | --- | ---------------- |
| 2018 | June      | 19  | When I was stuck in the Atlanta airport and you sent a picture of your GPS indicating your willingness to drive all that way to pick me up. |
| 2018 | June      | 20  | Cuddling up during the Incredibles 2, despite the armrests from the theater being in the way, which I'm sure was somewhat uncomfortable. |
| 2018 | June      | 21  | Helping me figure out what my look is and upgrade my fashion by picking out a new wardrobe, along with my mother. |
| 2018 | June      | 22  | Becoming friends on Pokemon Go and trading for the first time (a Magikarp). |
| 2018 | June      | 23  | Sleeping snuggled up together, falling asleep with you in my arms. |
| 2018 | June      | 24  | Experiencing your family at your grandma's birthday party, and seeing you interact with them all, especially the little ones. |
| 2018 | June      | 25  | Cooking for my family with me (even though I over-salted the eggplant). |
| 2018 | June      | 26  | How proud you were of your cauliflower dish (it tasted very good). |
| 2018 | June      | 27  | Parking in my street for a couple hours and showing me patience that I wasn't deserving. |
| 2018 | June      | 28  | Coming to see me before I left for my grandma's cabin. |
| 2018 | June      | 29  | As much as it hurt to hear about the pain, knowing that I was leaving for multiple days and wasn't going to be there to help, keeping me updated and so much explanation. Really an example of how open I should be, and something I want to take to heart. |
| 2018 | June      | 30  | I had a dream about trying to find you, and along the way I adopted a cat and a mouse that could talk, but only ever asked me to scratch it's head. And calling me while I was at the lake. |
| 2018 | July      |  1  | "You're so extra cute with a thicc beard!" |
| 2018 | July      |  2  | Sending me the song "Come and Get Your Love" as I drove to Hastings after being at the lake. |
| 2018 | July      |  3  | The beach! What a lovely time, lounging on the floaty, and feeding duck friends. |
| 2018 | July      |  4  | Hitting me in the face while wearing the frozen eye mask. |
| 2018 | July      |  5  | Playing battleship and chess, and interacting with my friends. |
| 2018 | July      |  6  | Cuddling in the morning after you slept over because we had drank so much the night before. |
| 2018 | July      |  7  | The "I love my job" snapchat with the extra long Pinocchio nose filter. |
| 2018 | July      |  8  | Going to J. Selbys, and sleeping cuddled together. |
| 2018 | July      |  9  | Taking me to the airport and all the supportive text messages as I ventured off to start my job. |
| 2018 | July      | 10  | The pride you displayed when building the desk all by yourself despite it saying another person would be needed. |
| 2018 | July      | 11  | Being there for me after a tough day at work when I was down about my ability to do my job. |
| 2018 | July      | 12  | The video you sent me of you opening the letter from Viterbo containing your diploma. So cute! |
| 2018 | July      | 13  | The advice to drink water before going to sleep so I would wake up having to pee and then be out of bed (which is the hardest part of the morning). |
| 2018 | July      | 14  | Getting me to head out into Boston (and end up walking 16.6 miles with 33,722 steps!) Because honestly I needed the push. |
| 2018 | July      | 15  | Finding out that we were both worried that the other would see us as lazy if we just wanted to lie in bed and cuddle. |
| 2018 | July      | 16  | M: "Do you know what I wish?" D: "That I was with you?" M: "... Also that. That the Hastings Target didn't close." |
| 2018 | July      | 17  | When you told me about putting in your two weeks. I could feel a difference. |
| 2018 | July      | 18  | Sending me apartments to look at to evaluate places we might choose to live together in. |
| 2018 | July      | 19  | All the work you put in toward looking up apartments, and setting up a day to go look at them while keeping in mind my work schedule. |
