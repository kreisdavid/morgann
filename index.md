I love Morgann McCarthy
=======================

Intro is a work in progress, but Morgann, I love you so much. And I don't always share all the times I feel it. I'm sorry.
This list is one moment from each day where I felt so loved, where I just so appreciated your love, where I felt an abundance of love for you, or something along those lines.
Just because I picked only one thing does not mean it was the only thing that day. That is never the case. But if I listed absolutely every action that made me feel love for you or from you, I wouldn't be able to keep up typing them all. 
My only regret is not thinking of this idea sooner.

| Year | Month     | Day | Where I Saw Love |

| 2018 | June      | 29  | As much as it hurt to hear about the pain, knowing that I was leaving for multiple days and wasn't going to be there to help, keeping me updated and so much explanation. Really an example of how open I should be, and something I want to take to heart. |
| 2018 | June      | 30  | I had a dream about trying to find you, and along the way I adopted a cat and a mouse that could talk, but only ever asked me to scratch it's head. And calling me while I was at the lake. |

| 2018 | December  | 30  | Coming over to my house and really whipping me into shape to get packed, not only the things that I will be moving out with the next day (which were mostly done), but also super importantly the stuff I am not planning on taking that will have to be packed up when my parents move to their new house. Your delegation and patience, yet persistence to get me to put it all away in boxes, saving me a lot of time in the future. (Also 50 Shades of GC, cannot leave that out) |
| 2018 | December  | 31  | Putting up with the hectic move in, putting your bed together as I abandoned you on a target run (it felt so bad to leave you alone for that long, and also do it while being at target. I felt so guilty.), and just being the most amazing girlfriend in existence. I am so in love with you. Happy new year my love <3 |
