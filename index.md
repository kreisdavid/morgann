I love Morgann McCarthy
=======================

Intro is a work in progress, but Morgann, I love you so much. And I don't always share all the times I feel it. I'm sorry.
This list is one moment from each day where I felt so loved, where I just so appreciated your love, where I felt an abundance of love for you, or something along those lines.
Just because I picked only one thing does not mean it was the only thing that day. That is never the case. But if I listed absolutely every action that made me feel love for you or from you, I wouldn't be able to keep up typing them all. 
My only regret is not thinking of this idea sooner.

| Year | Month     | Day | Where I Saw Love |
| ---- | --------- | --- | ---------------- |
| 2018 | June      | 19  | When I was stuck in the Atlanta airport and you sent a picture of your GPS indicating your willingness to drive all that way to pick me up. |
| 2018 | June      | 20  | Cuddling up during the Incredibles 2, despite the armrests from the theater being in the way, which I'm sure was somewhat uncomfortable. |
| 2018 | June      | 21  | Helping me figure out what my look is and upgrade my fashion by picking out a new wardrobe, along with my mother. |

| 2018 | June      | 29  | As much as it hurt to hear about the pain, knowing that I was leaving for multiple days and wasn't going to be there to help, keeping me updated and so much explanation. Really an example of how open I should be, and something I want to take to heart. |
| 2018 | June      | 30  | I had a dream about trying to find you, and along the way I adopted a cat and a mouse that could talk, but only ever asked me to scratch it's head. And calling me while I was at the lake. |
