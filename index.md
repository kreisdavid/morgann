I love Morgann McCarthy
=======================

Intro is a work in progress, but Morgann, I love you so much. And I don't always share all the times I feel it. I'm sorry.
This list is one moment from each day where I felt so loved, where I just so appreciated your love, where I felt an abundance of love for you, or something along those lines.
Just because I picked only one thing does not mean it was the only thing that day. That is never the case. But if I listed absolutely every action that made me feel love for you or from you, I wouldn't be able to keep up typing them all. 
My only regret is not thinking of this idea sooner.

| 2022 | February  | 10  | Your awareness while asleep to adapt to the situation, as evidenced by you falling asleep while watching Murderville but still somehow recognizing that I had closed the laptop and was trying to figure out where to put it, and then reaching over to grab it and put it on the ground somehow while staying asleep the whole time. |

| 2018 | December  | 13  | "I led you into my castle, you touched my beans, and now you're dead." Funny little stuff like this that provide a moment of "where did that come from" humor. |

| 2018 | December  | 28  | How you greet me when I walk into your place. It's interesting because I didn't actually experience it this time, because the lock did something weird and you had to come open the door for me, but as I was walking up to press the buzzer, I was thinking about how you were going to greet me when I walked in. Sometimes you try and scare me, sometimes you are laughing at some thing or another (or me), sometimes you are doing normal things but you just light up when I walk in and it makes me feel so loved. |

Your delegation and patience, yet persistence to get me to put it all away in boxes, saving me a lot of time in the future. (Also 50 Shades of GC, cannot leave that out) |
| 2018 | December  | 31  | Putting up with the hectic move in, putting your bed together as I abandoned you on a target run (it felt so bad to leave you alone for that long, and also do it while being at target.

| 2019 | January   | 25  | Seeing your new office in person! SO well organized, and I couldn't believe that all that stuff came from your previous tiny office. It's so good that you got more space, and you have already done amazing with it even with all those spare desks in the way. |
